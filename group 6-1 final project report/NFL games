# Introduction and Data

As a group of NFL fans and statisticians, we were curious to learn more about 
what factors provide NFL football teams both advantages and disadvantages during
a game. We desired to look at whether a team won or lost, and then 
cross-reference that result to different aspects of the game. These aspects 
include whether or not the team had home-field advantage, the yardage 
differentials of the game, as well as the amount of turnovers the team commits.

The data in this set comes from Pro Football Reference, a web-based database 
that collects information from NFL games dating back to the league's inception. 
Additionally, there is also supplementary data in the larger set including 
information about NFL game attendance and NFL standings. Our particular data set
is from the years 2000 - 2019, and includes game information from every contest 
held between these years. Relevant variables in this data set include:

home_team = home team playing the game 
away_team = away team playing the game 
winner = winner of the game 
pts_win = number of points scored by the winning team 
pts_loss = number of points scored by the losing team
turnovers_win = number of turnovers committed by winning team
turnovers_loss = number of turnovers committed by losing team
yds_win = number of total yards earned by winning team
yds_loss = number of total yards earned by losing team

Here is the link we used to access our selected data:
[NFL Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md)

Research Question: What aspects of a football game allow a team a more
likely chance of winning, and further, what factors indicate greater margins of
victory? 

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that playing at home, having a higher amount of 
turnovers forced than turnovers committed, and having a high yardage 
differential are all factors that contribute to a higher likelihood of a team 
winning. Additionally, we wanted to independently research what teams, during 
the 2000-2019 seasons, have had the highest-scoring wins.

# Methodology

**Research Question #1 - Home-Field Advantage?**

```{r home-or-away, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_games_home <- nfl_games %>%
  mutate(home_winner = if_else(home_team == winner, "Yes", "No"))
  ggplot(data = nfl_games_home,
mapping = aes(x = home_winner)) +
geom_bar(fill = "red", color = "blue") +
labs(title = "Do Home Teams Win More Often?",
     x = "Home Team?",
     y = "Number of Games")  
```

It is clear that playing at home gives teams a slight advantage, as home teams 
have won about 3,000 games in comparison to the roughly 2,250 games away teams 
have won. However, the difference between home and away win rates is only mildly
statistically significant, and so we cannot conclude for sure if playing at home
gives a team a definitive advantage. We chose to represent this data in a bar 
graph to clearly demonstrate how many teams have won home games versus away.

**Research Question #2- Turnover Differential**

For question 2, we employed three methods to test the correlation of turnovers 
on winning an NFL game.

Method 1: Simple Graphical Analysis

```{r turnovers, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_turnovers <- nfl_games %>%
  select(home_team, turnovers_win, turnovers_loss, winner) %>%
  arrange(desc(turnovers_win, desc(turnovers_loss))) %>%
   mutate(won_home = if_else(home_team == winner, "Home Team Won",
                            "Away Team Won")) %>%
mutate(greater_turnovers = if_else(turnovers_win>turnovers_loss, "Yes", "No"))
```

```{r turnovers-pt2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_turnovers %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = greater_turnovers, fill = won_home)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Does Turnover Differential Impact the Winner?",
       x = "Did the Winning Team Force More Turnovers Than the Losing Team?",
       y = "Chance of Winning", 
       subtitle = "Cross-Analyzed for Home-Field Advantage",
       fill = "Teams")
```

Based on this visualization, there does not seem to be a discernible difference 
in whether or not the winning team forced more turnovers than the losing team or
not. This finding is really interesting, because one would think that the more 
turnovers won the more likely the team is to win the game. However, there is 
only about a 5% difference between winning the game and having a higher number 
of turnovers won vs. winning the game and having a lower number of turnovers 
won than the losers. Additionally, it seems that whether or not the team is home
or away has any impact on turnover differential at all, indicating no 
correlation between these two variables.

Method 2: Linear Regression Modeling and Analysis

```{r lin-reg-for-turnover-diff, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_games_home <- nfl_games_home %>%
  mutate(to_diff = turnovers_win-turnovers_loss) %>%
  mutate(pts_diff = pts_win-pts_loss) %>%
  mutate(yds_diff = yds_win-yds_loss)
ggplot(data = nfl_games_home, aes(x = to_diff, y = pts_diff)) +
  labs(title = 
"Does Turnover Differential Determine Point Differential?", 
       x = "Turnover Differential", y = "Point Differential",
subtitle = "Differentials Calculated From Winning Team's Perspective") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "magenta")+
  ylim (0, 60)
pts_v_tos <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(pts_diff ~ to_diff, data = nfl_games_home)
tidy(pts_v_tos)
glance(pts_v_tos) %>% 
  pull(r.squared)
-(sqrt(0.1227718))
```

The linear regression plot displayed above comparing the difference in turnovers 
between the winning team and the losing team with the point difference shows 
that there appears to be a negative correlation between losing more turnovers 
and winning by more points. The strength of this model regression appears to 
also be medium-level. The r-squared value calculated from this model is 0.12277, 
indicating that 12.28% of the variability in point differential can be explained
by the turnover differential of the winning team. The square root of this value 
gets a calculation coefficient (adjusted for sign due to direction of regression
line on model) of - 0.3504, confirming a negative, medium strength correlation.
In addition, we calculated that for each one turnover increase in turnover
differential for the winning team, on average, it is predicted that the point 
differential will decrease by 1.90 points, with a standard deviation of .069 
points. This slope is neither particularly small or large, and thus, using all 
of the data derived from the model one can conclude that there exists a 
negative, yet mildly-correlated relationship between how many more turnovers the
winning team of an NFL game gives up versus that team's point differential over 
the losing team.

Method 3: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

The null hypothesis is that in games in which the home team won, the
turnover count from the home team is the same as the turnover count from
the away team.

The alternative hypothesis is that in games in which the home team won,
the turnover count from the home team is less than that of the away
team.

$H_0: \mu_H = \mu_A \text{ vs. }H_a: \mu_H < \mu_A$

```{r hyp-test-to, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_turnovers <- nfl_turnovers %>% 
  mutate(turnovers_diff = turnovers_win-turnovers_loss)
set.seed(2)
null_dist <- nfl_turnovers %>% 
    filter(won_home=="Home Team Won") %>% 
  specify(response = turnovers_diff) %>%
  hypothesise(null = "point", mu = 0) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

```{r visualized-null-dist-to, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x_bar <- nfl_turnovers %>% 
  filter(won_home=="Home Team Won") %>% 
  summarise(mean_difference = mean(turnovers_diff))
null_dist %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = "less")
visualise(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = "less") +
  labs(title = "Mean Distribution of Difference in Turnover Count in Games Won
       by Home Team", 
  x = "Sample mean", y = "Count")
```

```{r null-dist-to, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
set.seed(4)
null_dist_quantile <- nfl_turnovers %>%
  filter(won_home == "Home Team Won") %>% 
specify(response = turnovers_diff) %>%
generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
calculate(stat = "mean")
null_dist_quantile %>% 
     summarise(lower = quantile(stat, 0.025),
            upper = quantile(stat, 0.975))
```

We also used a hypothesis test to determine if the mean difference in
turnovers between the home team and away team (in games where the home
team won) is 0. Following this hypothesis test, we calculated a p-value
of 0, which allows us to reject our null hypothesis that there is no
difference in mean turnovers between the two teams. Therefore, we are
able to state that there is a good chance that the mean difference
between the home team's turnovers and the away team's turnovers is less
than 0 (meaning that, on average, the home team had less turnovers).
This would make sense because turning over the ball many times is
conducive to losing a football game.

According to our 95% confidence interval, the lower bound is -1.07
difference in turnovers and the upper bound is -0.95 difference in
turnovers. We are 95% confident that the real mean falls within this
confidence interval. In the context of the data, since this interval
does not contain the null hypothesis, the results are statistically
significant, and it is unlikely that the mean difference between home
team's and away team's turnovers is 0. Therefore, this confidence
interval is more consistent with the alternative hypothesis because its
range is in this interval, whereas the null hypothesis is not.

**Research Question #3 - Yard Differentials**

```{r lin-reg-for-yard-diff, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nfl_games_home, aes(x = yds_diff, y = pts_diff)) +
  labs(title = 
    "Does Yard Differential Determine Point Differential?", 
       x = "Yard Differential", y = "Point Differential", 
    subtitle = "Differentials Calculated From Winning Team's Perspective" ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "green") +
  ylim (0, 60)
pts_v_yds <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(pts_diff ~ yds_diff, data = nfl_games_home)
tidy(pts_v_yds)
glance(pts_v_yds) %>% 
  pull(r.squared)
sqrt(0.1924721)
```

As seen in the above linear regression plot comparing the difference in yardage 
between the winning team and the losing team with the point difference, there
appears to be a positive correlation between obtaining more yards and winning by
more points. The strength of this model regression, however, appears to be 
medium-level. The r-squared value calculated from this model is 0.19247, 
indicating that 19.25% of the variability in point differential can be explained
by the yard differential of the winning team. The square root of this value gets
a calculation coefficient of 0.4392, confirming a positive, medium strength
correlation. In addition, we calculated that for each yard earned more than the 
opposing team, on average, it is predicted that the point differential will 
increase by 0.04 points, with a standard deviation of .001 points. This slope is
small, and thus, using all of the data derived from the model one can conclude 
that there exists a positive, yet mildly-correlated relationship between how 
many more yards the winning team of an NFL game obtains versus that team's point
differential over the loser.

```{r probability, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_games %>%
  group_by(winner) %>%
  count(yds_win) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  tibble() %>%
   distinct(winner, .keep_all= TRUE)
nfl_games %>%
  group_by(winner) %>%
  count(yds_loss) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  tibble() %>%
  distinct(winner, .keep_all= TRUE)
  
```

Above is the probability of teams winning based on the amount of yards
won and yards lost in the game. We can see that when teams earn a lot of
yards per game, that team is more likely to win the game. In contrast,
when teams lose yards, they then become less likely to win the game.
However, the percentages are extremely low which tells us that losing
yards often does not have a strong correlation with winning the game.

**Additional Research - Highest-Scorers**

```{r nfl-points-win, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_points_win <- nfl_games %>%
  mutate(pts_win_1 = pts_win>58) %>%
  filter(pts_win_1 == TRUE) 
```

```{r nfl-points-win-pt2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
nfl_points_win %>%
ggplot(aes(x = winner)) + geom_bar(fill = "pink", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Winning Teams With the Most Number of Points", 
       x = "Winner Team Name", 
       y = "Number of Times a Team Won and had more than 58 Points")
```

In this graph we filtered out the number of teams that won and had more
than 58 points in the game. This mutate gave us 5 different teams and 6
variables, as The New England Patriots won twice with more than 58
points. The Ravens, Patriots, Saints, Raiders, and Eagles are the five
teams with the highest winning scores throughout the season. The
Patriots is the only time with more than 58 points twice.

#Results

Our research mission was to investigate if there were any factors that 
contributed to a higher likelihood of a team winning an NFL game. In particular,
we analyzed the impact of home-field advantage, turnover differential, and
yardage differential. In regards to home-field advantage, according to our 
graphical analysis there is certainly a positive, mildly strong correlation 
between a team playing at home and that team winning. For aspect two, we
utilized three different methods to analyze the correlation between turnovers 
and winning. We arrived at mixed conclusions using these different methods, with
the graphical analysis yielding no strong correlation while the hypothesis 
testing did. We have decided to trust the more reliable results from the 
hypothesis test, which does not cross-examine for any other variables other than
turnover differential. This method yielded two conclusions: turnovers
are mildly correlated to both winning and winning by more extreme margins. In
respect to factor number three, yardage differential, our results indicate a
positive, mild correlation between having more yards than an opponent and 
winning/ winning by more extreme margins.

#Discussion

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we find that all three tested variables - home-field
advantage, turnover differential, and yardage differential - are all mildly 
accurate in determining the winner of an NFL game. Being at home, in front of a
crowd rooting for your team's success and the other team's failure, is sure to
give the home team the much needed boost it takes to win a game. In addition, it
is logical to assume that a team with more yards and turnovers forced will be
more successful, and so none of the results were particularly surprising. The
fact that yardage and turnover differentials correlate with more extreme point
margins also presents a logical line of reasoning, and so ultimately, the
research confirmed our initial hypotheses. In regards to our extra research
item, we have found that the New England Patriots possess the most 58+ point
games in the 2000 to 2019 stretch of the NFL.

Discussion/Reflection:
Researching these correlations was difficult, and in hindsight, we could have 
went about the experiment with a more thorough and diligent approach. Our 
methodology could have used more structure and consistency, as we opted for 
variability in our methods (linear regression, bar graphs, hypothesis testing, 
etc.) instead of organization. As a result, we feel like our research may come 
off as a bit disjointed, but in the end it reached the necessary conclusions to 
make a proper judgment on our conclusions, which was our group's primary goal. 
The data set was detailed and large, with one of its major limitations being 
that it did not include more advanced metrics that could have allowed for the
investigation of more unique relationships to winning NFL games. Perhaps, if
statistics such as passing yards, rushing yards, and special teams yards were
included in the data set, we could have made more interesting conclusions to
test which aspects of football most correlate to success. Overall, although
our project could have used more structure and tested for more interesting
relationships between variables, we feel that we have done a satisfactory job in
arriving at the conclusions we set out to determine.
